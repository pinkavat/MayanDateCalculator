# Mayan Date Calculator

My very first non-trivial coding project, a java applet for calculating Mayan Hieroglyphic dates.
Supports conversion between Gregorian Calendar dates, Mayan Long Count dates, and days since the start of the Mayan Universe.

*Want to see the associated hieroglyphs? Check out [my calculator website](https://polar-gorge-17146.herokuapp.com/)!*

*Want a lightweight C widget that prints the current Mayan date? See [here](https://github.com/pinkavat/currentMayanDate)!*

## Installation

Download [MayanDateCalculator.java](MayanDateCalculator.java) and [MayanDate.java](MayanDate.java), place them in a directory, and compile with a java compiler, for instance:
```
javac MayanDateCalculator
```
Compilation will result in two java class files. The compiler may issue some warnings -- the project is very old.

## Usage

Running MayanDateCalculator.class (with MayanDate.class, the calculator code, in the same directory) will open the Calculator GUI:
